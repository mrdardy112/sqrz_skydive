# sqrz_skydive
The SQRZ  Skydiving script  is a lightweight FiveM resource for realistic skydiving. Players are teleported to an altitude of 4500m, automatically receive a parachute, and get appropriate notifications. Admins can use /skydiving [ID] or exports like StartSkyDive. It features a clear structure, is ESX-compatible, and is ideal for RP and fun servers.
